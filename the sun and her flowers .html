      <h1>about the author</h1>
      <p style="font-size: larger; ">A breakout literary phenomenon and #1 New York Times Bestselling Author, Rupi Kaur wrote, illustrated, and self-published her first poetry collection, 'milk and honey' in 2014. Next came its artistic siblings 'the sun and her flowers' and ‘home body’, both debuting at #1 on bestseller lists across the world. These collections have sold more than 11 million copies and have been translated into over 43 languages. Most recently in 2022- she released her 4th book ‘Healing Through Words’ which is a journey of guided writing exercises to help the reader explore their creativity.
      
        As she has done from the very beginning, Rupi self-produced ‘Rupi Kaur Live’, the first poetry special of its kind, which debuted on Amazon Prime Video in 2021.
        
        Rupi Kaur graces stages across the globe on sold-out world tours. These shows are a poetic theatrical experience interlaced with her own touch of stand-up. Her work touches on love, loss, trauma, healing, femininity, and migration. She feels most at home when creating art, performing her poetry onstage, and spending time with family and friends.</p>

      <h1>summary of the book </h1>
      <p style="font-size: larger; " >A vibrant and transcendent journey about growth and healing. Ancestry and honoring one’s roots. Expatriation and rising up to find a home within yourself. Divided into five chapters and illustrated by Kaur, the sun and her flowers is a journey of wilting, falling, rooting, rising, and blooming. A celebration of love in all its forms. this is the recipe of life said my mother as she held me in her arms as i wept think of those flowers you plant in the garden each year they will teach you that people too must wilt fall root rise in order to bloom</p>

      <p style="font-size: larger;"> I hear a thousand kind words about me and it makes no difference yet I hear one insult and all confidence shatters - focusing on the negative.”
        I've never related to written words as much as reading Rupi Kaur's books.</p>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <p style="font-size: larger;"> Actual Rating: 3.25 stars
        This was definitely better than Milk and honey but it was somewhat repetitive!
        I kind of have a feeling that Rupi should write a novel in her writing style, She reminds me of Tahereh Mafi's style that can work better as poetic writing rather than Poem, I don't know if I am making much sense but that's how I feel!</p>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <p style="font-size: larger;">I don't know, it really wasn't that impressive.</q>
