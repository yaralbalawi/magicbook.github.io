      <h1>about the author</h1>
      <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder;">Charlie Macksey was born during a snowy winter in Northumberland. He has been a cartoonist for The Spectator and a book illustrator for Oxford University Press. He has collaborated with Richard Curtis for Comic Relief, and Nelson Mandela on a lithograph project, 'The Unity Series.' Collectors of Mackesy's works include Elizabeth Gilbert, Whoopi Goldberg, Roger Waters, Richard Curtis, The Murdoch Freuds, Tim Bevan, M. Night Shyamalan, Bear Grylls, Howard Goodall, Harry Enfield, and Sting. He has lived and painted in South Africa, Southern Africa, and New Orleans. He co-runs a social enterprise, Mama Buci, in the Zambian copperbelt, which helps families of low and no income to become beekeepers.

      <h1>summary of the book </h1>
      <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder;" >Enter the world of Charlie's four unlikely friends, discover their story and their most important life lessons. The boy, the mole, the fox and the horse have been shared millions of times online - perhaps you've seen them? They've also been recreated by children in schools and hung on hospital walls. They sometimes even appear on lamp posts and on cafe and bookshop windows. Perhaps you saw the boy and mole on the Comic Relief T-shirt, Love Wins?

      <h1>book reviwes </h1>
      <q style="font-size: larger;"> I listened to the audio of this, narrated beautifully by Charlie Mackesy in a meditative style that is sublime and just begs to be listened to again and again, whenever you feel the need for it. This is the perfect read and listen in our turbulent crisis hit times, helping to knit back together our battered bodies and souls. I would certainly recommend it for the simplicity of its pearls of wisdom for those suffering from certain mental health issues, such as depression. Needless to say, I am not surprised that this is loved by so many. If you have not read or heard this, I strongly urge you to give it a try. Pure gold.</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;"> Nothing exactly new... but what can I say? It's a book written to comfort people. And it seems like it has accomplished that goal for many.</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;">Written in a hard to read font, I found this disjointed effort quite disappointing. There are some nice quotes but no connecting thread or continuous flow as it lacks a narrative. Both the story and the artwork seemed unfinished and I am left feeling incomplete in my understanding of the popularity of this book.</q>
