      <h1>about the author</h1>
      <p style="font-size: larger;">Emily Dickinson was an American poet who, despite the fact that less than a dozen of her nearly eighteen hundred poems were published during her lifetime, is widely considered one of the most original and influential poets of the 19th century.
        Dickinson was born to a successful family with strong community ties, she lived a mostly introverted and reclusive life. After she studied at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she spent a short time at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room. Most of her friendships were therefore carried out by correspondence</p>

      <h1>summary of the book </h1>
      <p style="font-size: larger; " >Part of a new collection of literary voices from Gibbs Smith, written by, and for, extraordinary women--to encourage, challenge, and inspire.
      
        One of American's most distinctive poets, Emily Dickinson scorned the conventions of her day in her approach to writing, religion, and society. Hope Is the Thing with Feathers is a collection of her vast archive of poetry to inspire the writers, creatives, and feminists of today.</p>

      <q style="font-size: larger;"> Emily Dickinson's poetry is stunningly existential and her story is equally fascinating.<br> Such a great collection to dip in and out of, and no-one writes a striking opening line quite like her.</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;"> This is a huge volume of poetry and probably not meant to be read straight through, but that's what I did. Some of them I didn't like or understand,<br> but there were many that I thought were beautiful and perfectly suited to my feelings. I think that's the way with most poets and their readers. After reading, I was left in wonder about this strange and reclusive woman who saw only a handful of her poems published before her death. She never knew she would be a success, never knew her poems would be loved by millions of people, and never knew she would be considered one of the greatest American poets.</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;"> After reading through most of these poems, Emily remains one of my top favorite poets. However, I also came across many poems that I felt no connection with and frankly made no sense to me. So with that in mind,<br> I unfortunately couldn't give this 5 stars. Still a great experience though!I highly recommend this book if you're a fan of poetry and/or Emily Dickinson</q>
