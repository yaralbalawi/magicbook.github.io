      <h1>summary of the book </h1>
      <p style="font-size: larger;" >Could you survive on your own in the wild, with every one out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?
      
        In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.
        
        Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.</p>

      <h1>book reviwes </h1>
      <q style="font-size: larger;"> Absolute solid gold standard. Phenomenal. Don't let the movies pollute your memories of this book, it is OUTSTANDING.</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;"> "The Most Dangerous Game" meets Survivor. I loved it: deft characterization wrapped tightly around this lean, brutal plot that absolutely grabbed me and hung on. This was one that I started reading in the morning and snarled at all comers until I had finished it in the evening. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;">Clearly, some books just never get old. By now I know The Hunger Games almost by heart, but it still manages to stir me in all the good/bad ways. I can't tell what exactly it is that works so well - the absolutely perfect pacing, the heart, Katniss' unforgettable voice or her love for Prim and Rue, or Peeta's kindness. Whatever it is, this book keeps me in thrall every time and makes me forget about the ultimately shoddy dystopian premise.</q>
