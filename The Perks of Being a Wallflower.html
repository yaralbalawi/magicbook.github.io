      <h1>summary of the book </h1>
      <p style="font-size: larger; " >standing on the fringes of life...
        offers a unique perspective. But there comes a time to see
        what it looks like from the dance floor.
        
        This haunting novel about the dilemma of passivity vs. passion marks the stunning debut of a provocative new voice in contemporary fiction: The Perks of Being A WALLFLOWER
        
        This is the story of what it's like to grow up in high school. More intimate than a diary, Charlie's letters are singular and unique, hilarious and devastating. We may not know where he lives. We may not know to whom he is writing. All we know is the world he shares. Caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it puts him on a strange course through uncharted territory. The world of first dates and mixed tapes, family dramas and new friends. The world of sex, drugs, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, when all one requires is that the perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite.
        
        Through Charlie, Stephen Chbosky has created a deeply affecting coming-of-age story, a powerful novel that will spirit you back to those wild and poignant roller coaster days known as growing up.

      <h1>book reviwes </h1>
      <q style="font-size: larger;"> I don't even think I can truly convey how much I loved this book other than to say it was entirely life changing and I'm so upset it took me this long to read it.</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;"> I think I would have liked this book a lot more in Junior High than I did as an adult. While the plot was compelling to read, the writing was too simple to feel rewarding to me.</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;">The melodrama has to stop, people. Yes, being a teenager is hard; yes, it's harder when there are emotional issues in the mix. But I just can't deal with characters that fade into the background of their own stories. If you're writing in the first person, we should get a better sense of the narrator.</q>
