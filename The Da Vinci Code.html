      <p style="font-size: larger;" >
        While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. While working to solve the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci — clues visible for all to see — yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.
        
        Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion — an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others.
        
        In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who seems to anticipate their every move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory’s ancient secret — and an explosive historical truth — will be lost forever.</p>

      <q style="font-size: larger;"> Back then everybode read that book! You won't regret reading it. It has quite a controversial theory to offer and is full of suspense!</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;"> As a person who often gets tired of the plot of the book, this was very easy to read because it had a new plot twist at the end of almost every chapter, which made me stay motivated throughout the whole book</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;">Hot take; it was just ok. The plot is well thought out and definitely required intricit planning. But there's no character development, the writing isn't great, and I found myself frequently rolling my eyes. I haven't seen the movie yet but I can definitely see the movie being better in this case.
        Not bad, just not worth all the hype.</q>
