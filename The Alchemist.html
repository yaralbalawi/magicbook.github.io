      <h1>about the author</h1>
      <p style="font-size: larger; ">The Brazilian author PAULO COELHO was born in 1947 in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Before dedicating his life completely to literature, he worked as theatre director and actor, lyricist and journalist. In 1986, PAULO COELHO did the pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostella, an experience later to be documented in his book The Pilgrimage. In the following year, COELHO published The Alchemist. Slow initial sales convinced his first publisher to drop the novel, but it went on to become one of the best selling Brazilian books of all time.</p>

      <h1>summary of the book </h1>
      <p style="font-size: larger; " >Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery, The Alchemist has become a modern classic, selling millions of copies around the world and transforming the lives of countless readers across generations.
      
        Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, following our dreams.</p>

      <q style="font-size: larger;"> This book was very very good. I liked its lessons and how charming it was. The characters were enjoyable, even if none of them had names. The locations were incredible, and the story was moving. I feel like i appreciate the world around me a little more. I don’t have any downsides to this book.</q>
      <br>
      <Br>
      <q style="font-size: larger;"> A beautiful story that inspires you to chase your dreams and view the world with wonder and curiosity. This pleasant read provides many quote-worthy passages that continue to inspire long after the book's conclusion. Perfect for young adults.</q>

      <q style="font-size: larger;"> I think if you read this book too seriously, you either will hate it or enjoy it. For me, I thought the messaging was cute - hopeful, romantic, and rather unrealistic. The meeting between the boy and Fatima was so sudden and it felt quite out of the blue. I know that this isn’t necessarily a romance book, but the little of it that was in here didn’t feel romantic at all. There was nothing that occurred between the two that would cause me to believe that he’d travel the entire desert and she’d wait for him to return.</q>
